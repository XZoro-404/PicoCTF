#### Description

Can you find the flag in [file](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/static/495d43ee4a2b9f345a4307d053b4d88d/file)? This would be really tedious to look through manually, something tells me there is a better way.

### Step 1
1. Using egrep (grep with regular expression 'grep -E') we can look for the string 'pico' using the following command `egrep 'pico.* file'`
