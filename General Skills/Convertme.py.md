#### Description
Run the Python script and convert the given number from decimal to binary to get the flag. [Download Python script](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/23/convertme.py)


> [!hint]- Hint 1
> Look up a decimal to binary number conversion app on the web or use your computer's calculator!

> [!hint]- Hint 2
> The `str_xor` function does not need to be reverse engineered for this challenge.

> [!hint]- Hint 3
> If you have Python on your computer, you can download the script normally and run it. Otherwise, use the `wget` command in the webshell.

> [!hint]- Hint 4
> To use `wget` in the webshell, first right click on the download link and select 'Copy Link' or 'Copy Link Address'

> [!hint]- Hint 5
> Type everything after the dollar sign in the webshell: `$ wget` , then paste the link after the space after `wget` and press enter. This will download the script for you in the webshell so you can run it!

> [!hint]- Hint 6
> Finally, to run the script, type everything after the dollar sign and then press enter: `$ python3 convertme.py`
